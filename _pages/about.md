I am senior scientist in the <a href='https://etranselec.ch/'>Electrical Energy Efficiency Group</a> at the <a href='https://www.hevs.ch/'>HES-SO Valais-Wallis</a>, in the town of <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/2KSLcLG25jX94kfU9'>Sion, Switzerland</a>.
My research interests are mostly in three domains:

- **Electrical power grids**
- **Machine learning**
- **High-energy physics**

I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve current problems in power systems, such as power flow optimization through topological changes, or modelling of hydroelectric production.
A sample of my projects can be found on the [dedicated page](/projects).

My background is in high-energy physics. I got my Ph.D. from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch), studying the possibility that the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) is a composite particle. After that I was a postdoc at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cp3-origins-sdu/), at [UC Davis](https://qmap.ucdavis.edu/) (USA), at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lptp/) (Switzerland), and finally at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) (Italy). I became an expert in [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory), a particular case of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) with [scale invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance) in which we have a decent and growing understanding of the strong-coupling regime.

Before joining my current institution, I worked for a while as developer and cloud architect at [SCS](https://www.scs.ch), a software company located in Zurich.
