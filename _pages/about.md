I am a theoretical physicist with industry experience in software development. I am currently employed as senior scientist at the <a href='https://www.hevs.ch/'>HES-SO Valais-Wallis</a>, in my home town of <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/2KSLcLG25jX94kfU9'>Sion, Switzerland</a>.

My research interests are in three domains:


### Power grids

...

### Machine learning

...

### High-energy physics

I originally graduated in high-energy physics, with a Ph.D. thesis on the Higgs boson and the possibility that it is a composite particle. After that I was a postdoc at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cp3-origins-sdu/), at [UC Davis](https://qmap.ucdavis.edu/) (USA), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lptp/) (Switzerland), and at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) (Italy). I became an expert in [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory), a special case of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) with [scale invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance) in which we have a decent (and growing) understanding of the strong-coupling regime.
