**SwissCyberGrid** is part of a project funded by the [armasuisse Cyber-Defence Campus](https://www.cydcampus.admin.ch/), whose objective is to study the resilience of the electrical transmission grid of Switzerland against cyberattacks.

The focus is on false data injection attacks that affect the operator's knowledge of the grid state. We created an interactive tool that can be used to visualize what the operator sees and compare with the real state of the grid. Several detections algorithms can be tested in various conditions.

I wrote [the backend API](https://github.com/GeeeHesso/AramisAPI.jl) for this project in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), while the frontend was developed by [GwenaÃ«lle Gustin](https://www.gwengustin.ch/) and the [group of David Wannier at the HES-SO](https://www.hevs.ch/en/applied-research/research-institute-informatics/easilab-13431). The detection algorithms have been developed by our research group, and will be described in an upcoming publication.

The result is visible below (large screens only). It can be found otherwise at [https://swisscybergrid.iigweb.hevs.ch/](https://swisscybergrid.iigweb.hevs.ch/).
